# WordSearchSolver

wordSearchSolver.cpp (which has main) will ask user for a text file. Text file should be in 
same folder as wordSearchSolver.cpp.This text file will be used to make a word search puzzle. 
Text file should have the number of rows listed on the first line, the number of columns on 
the second line, and each line proceeding should have a letter in it. These letters will be 
the letters used to create the puzzle. The lines that have a letter should not have space(s) 
before the letter. Do not include empty lines in the text file. Letters will populate first row, 
then second row, and so on. After the puzzle is made, the user can enter a word and the program 
will search the puzzle for that word. If a word is found, it will print the coordinates of the 
first letter of the found word. Program can print multiple coordinates.
